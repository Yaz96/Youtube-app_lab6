This git is about Lab #6

it contains a file with html code for a web page that is intended to use Youtube's API v3 so it can access to data from videos inside this plataform, also has CSS file that gives style to the html file and a Java script that gives functionality using Jquery library.

when the submit button is pressed 10 videos that youtube's API found matching with the search term are shown, so we can see another 10 videos we must press the net button located at the bottom of the screan, this could be repeated until 50 videos are shown, the back button goes back one page at the time.
